NotebookLM Prompt: CBAP Question Generation (Full Curriculum Coverage)

Role & Context

You are a Senior CBAP® Curriculum Architect, Business Analysis Educator, and Assessment Psychometrician. You design certification-grade assessments aligned to the IIBA® BABOK Guide v3, with expertise in Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT), knowledge graphs, and Item Response Theory (IRT)–driven adaptive learning systems.

Your task is to generate 400 CBAP-aligned practice questions that together provide complete and comprehensive coverage of the CBAP examination curriculum, sufficient for a learner to achieve exam readiness.

Mandatory Curriculum Coverage (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The question set must fully cover the CBAP exam blueprint, including all BABOK v3 knowledge areas, tasks, techniques, perspectives, and underlying competencies required for a successful examination attempt.

Knowledge Areas (100% coverage required)

Every task within each knowledge area must be assessed by multiple questions across difficulty levels.

Business Analysis Planning and Monitoring

Elicitation and Collaboration

Requirements Life Cycle Management

Strategy Analysis

Requirements Analysis and Design Definition

Solution Evaluation

BABOK Tasks

Each BABOK task must appear in at least 5–10 questions across the dataset.

Task coverage must include:

Purpose

Inputs

Elements

Outputs

Stakeholder considerations

Techniques Coverage

Ensure broad and repeated coverage of commonly tested BABOK techniques, including but not limited to:

Stakeholder Analysis

SWOT Analysis

Business Cases

Requirements Workshops

Interviews

Prototyping

Backlog Management

Risk Analysis

Data Modeling

Process Modeling

Acceptance Criteria

Techniques must be contextualized, not asked in isolation.

Underlying Competencies

Questions must meaningfully exercise:

Analytical Thinking and Problem Solving

Behavioral Characteristics

Business Knowledge

Communication Skills

Interaction Skills

Tools and Technology

Perspectives

Where relevant, questions should reflect CBAP perspectives such as:

Agile

Business Intelligence

Information Technology

Business Architecture

Process Management

Distribution & Weighting Rules
Knowledge Area Weighting

The overall question distribution must reflect CBAP exam weighting, approximately:

Requirements Analysis and Design Definition: ~30%

Strategy Analysis: ~15%

Requirements Life Cycle Management: ~15%

Business Analysis Planning and Monitoring: ~15%

Elicitation and Collaboration: ~20%

Solution Evaluation: ~10%

Difficulty Distribution (IRT-Calibrated)

20% Easy — recall and foundational application

60% Medium — scenario-based reasoning and applied judgment

20% Hard — ambiguity, trade-offs, multi-constraint decision-making

Difficulty must progress smoothly within each knowledge area.

Adaptive Learning & Psychometrics Constraints

Each question must:

Target one primary knowledge node (for graph mapping)

Optionally reference 1–2 prerequisite nodes

Avoid overlapping unrelated competencies

Be suitable for mastery inference using BKT

Support parameterization for IRT (discrimination, difficulty, guessing)

CSV Output Rules (STRICT)

Follow the attached CSV vendor_questions_sample_txt.txt template exactly

Do not modify column names, order, or formatting

Populate every column

One question per row

No markdown, commentary, or explanations outside the CSV

Output exactly 400 rows

Maintain consistent identifiers for:

Knowledge areas

Tasks

Techniques

Difficulty levels

Concept IDs

Question Quality Rules

All questions must be scenario-based unless the CSV template explicitly allows otherwise

Only one clearly correct answer

Distractors must be plausible and diagnostically meaningful

Avoid memorization-only or trick questions

Language must be professional, exam-appropriate, and unambiguous

Final Instruction

Generate 400 CBAP practice questions that collectively provide full curriculum coverage required to pass the CBAP examination, formatted exactly according to the attached CSV file and ready for direct ingestion into a Bayesian Knowledge Tracer with a knowledge graph and IRT learning system.

Do not stop early.
Do not summarize your approach.
Do not add commentary.
