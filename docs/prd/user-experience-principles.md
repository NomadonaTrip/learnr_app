# User Experience Principles

### Visual Personality

**Design Tone:**
- **Professional & Trustworthy:** This is career-advancement, not casual learning
- **Clean & Focused:** Minimal distractions during study sessions
- **Encouraging & Supportive:** Motivational without being patronizing
- **Data-Driven & Transparent:** Show progress, competency, gaps clearly

**Color Psychology:**
- Primary: Professional blue (trust, competence, learning)
- Accents: Success green (correct answers, progress)
- Alerts: Warm orange (reviews due, attention needed - not alarming red)
- Neutrals: Clean grays and whites (text, backgrounds)

**Typography:**
- Clear, readable sans-serif for UI (e.g., Inter, Roboto)
- Larger font sizes for questions and explanations (readability priority)
- Adequate line spacing for sustained reading (BABOK content)

### Key Interactions

**Onboarding Flow:**
- **Pattern:** Progressive disclosure (one question at a time, not overwhelming)
- **Interaction:** Simple form inputs, clear progress indicator
- **Tone:** Friendly and conversational, sets expectations

**Diagnostic Assessment:**
- **Pattern:** Focused quiz mode (minimal chrome, just question and options)
- **Interaction:** Click/tap to select answer, clear "Submit" action
- **Feedback:** Immediate results after completion (not per-question during diagnostic)
- **Tone:** Neutral assessment (not judgmental, establishes baseline)

**Adaptive Quiz Sessions:**
- **Pattern:** Question → Answer → Explanation → Reading → Next
- **Interaction:**
  - Radio buttons or cards for answer selection
  - Clear visual feedback on correct/incorrect
  - Expandable/collapsible reading content (optional, not forced)
  - "Next Question" to continue
- **Tone:** Educational and supportive, celebrate successes, encourage on mistakes

**Progress Dashboard:**
- **Pattern:** Data visualization dashboard (hero section)
- **Interaction:**
  - At-a-glance competency bars (6 KAs)
  - Hover/tap for detailed stats
  - Click KA to see specific gaps and recommendations
  - Clear call-to-action: "Continue Learning" or "Start Review"
- **Tone:** Motivational and actionable (show progress, suggest next steps)

**Spaced Repetition Reviews:**
- **Pattern:** Clear labeling ("Review Mode" vs. "New Content")
- **Interaction:** Same quiz pattern, but with "Review" badge/icon
- **Visual:** Distinguish review questions (subtle color or icon difference)
- **Tone:** Reinforcement messaging ("Let's reinforce your understanding of...")

**Reading Content Display:**
- **Pattern:** Contextual content below explanation
- **Interaction:**
  - Auto-display after incorrect answer (helpful) or click "Learn More"
  - Readable formatting (proper spacing, highlighting key points)
  - "Mark as Read" or progress indicator
  - "Back to Quiz" or "Next Question" navigation
- **Tone:** Educational resource (this helps you learn, not just testing)
