**Learning Efficiency:**
- **30% reduction in total study time** vs. traditional methods (through adaptive targeting)
- **90%+ users feel "exam-ready"** before taking the test (confidence metric)

**Engagement Indicators:**
- **80%+ daily active usage** during prep period (consistent engagement)
- **70%+ completion rate** (users who start complete their prep journey)
- **Spaced repetition reviews maintain 70%+ accuracy** (retention validation)
- **70%+ post-session review adoption rate** (NEW - users engage with review feature)
- **60%+ reinforcement success rate** (NEW - incorrect → correct on review)
- **50%+ reading completion rate** (NEW - vs 25% baseline with inline reading, +100% improvement)

**v2.1 Feature Validation (Async Reading Library):**
*Source: `docs/Asynchronous_Reading_Model.md` Lines 969-977 - Expected improvements from async model*

| Metric | Baseline (v2.0 Inline) | Target (v2.1 Async) | Improvement |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Reading engagement rate | 25% | 60%+ | +140% |
| Avg questions/session | 12 | 18+ | +50% |
| Session completion rate | 65% | 80%+ | +23% |
| Reading completion rate | 25% | 50%+ | +100% |

**Baseline Context:** v2.0 synchronous inline reading (deprecated) showed 25% engagement due to learning flow interruption. v2.1 asynchronous reading library targets 60%+ engagement through zero-interruption "test fast, read later" model.
