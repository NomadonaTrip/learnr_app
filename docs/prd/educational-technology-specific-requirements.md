# Educational Technology Specific Requirements

### Student Privacy & Data Protection

**Privacy Considerations:**
- User study data is personal and potentially sensitive (performance, gaps, struggles)
- Learning progress reveals user weaknesses (could impact confidence if exposed)
- Time spent and engagement patterns are behavioral data
- Exam results and certification goals are career-related information

**Data Handling Requirements:**
- Clear privacy policy explaining data usage
- User consent for data collection and AI processing
- No third-party data sharing without explicit consent
- Data retention policies (how long we keep performance data)
- User right to delete account and all associated data
- Secure storage of personally identifiable information (PII)

**Regulatory Compliance:**
- While COPPA/FERPA don't directly apply (adult learners, not K-12/university), follow privacy best practices
- Prepare for GDPR compliance (if expanding to EU users)
- Clear terms of service and user agreements

### Accessibility Requirements

**Target Accessibility Level: WCAG 2.1 Level AA**

**Critical Accessibility Features:**
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Screen reader compatibility (semantic HTML, ARIA labels)
- Sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- Text resizing without loss of functionality (up to 200%)
- Focus indicators on interactive elements
- Alternative text for any images or diagrams
- Captions for any video/audio content (if added)

**Rationale:** Professional learners may have disabilities; ensuring accessibility broadens market and demonstrates quality.

### Content Quality & Moderation

**Content Accuracy Requirements:**
- Vendor questions validated by CBAP experts
- LLM-generated questions reviewed against gold standard
- Regular content quality audits
- User feedback mechanism for incorrect questions
- Content update process as BABOK evolves

**Explanation Quality:**
- All explanations reviewed for accuracy
- Clear, professional language (no ambiguity)
- References to BABOK sections when relevant
- User feedback on explanation helpfulness

**Reading Content Integrity:**
- BABOK content used appropriately (fair use for MVP, licensing for GA)
- Proper attribution and sourcing
- No modification of original BABOK meaning
- Chunk boundaries respect concept boundaries (don't break mid-concept)
