# Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: User Registration & Onboarding

User completes 7-question onboarding flow (anonymous), then creates account with onboarding data persisted to profile.

### Workflow 2: Initial Diagnostic Assessment

User takes 12-question diagnostic (3 per KA) with no feedback during assessment, competency calculated at end.

### Workflow 3: Adaptive Quiz Session with Answer Submission

User answers question, receives immediate feedback + explanation, reading queue populated asynchronously (zero-interruption).

### Workflow 4: Post-Session Review

User completes session with incorrect answers, immediately re-answers them for reinforcement (2-3x better retention).

### Workflow 5: Accessing Asynchronous Reading Library
